# Audio Streaming Services of IntelliMeet !!

## Implemented P2P Audio streaming service using TCP protocol (via peer-peer IP:Port_Address binding)
- Using Socket IO connections the audio byte streams are transfered between two users in real-time.

## Dependencies
#### Required python-libraries for video-streaming
- openai-whisper ```pip install -U openai-whisper```
- PyTorch (install this library using the shell command and instruction listed in this website ```https://pytorch.org/```)
- transformers ```pip install transformers```
- pickle ```pip install pickle```
- struct ```pip install struct```
- socket ```pip install socket```
- imutils ```pip install imutils```

- Install above dependencies to run the audio_streaming service.

## Instructions
- edit the IP and Port addresses in the server ```Video_dual_server_communication.py``` and client service files accordingly ```Video_dual_client_communication.py```
- run the ```Video_dual_server_communication.py``` and ```Video_dual_client_communication.py``` seperately in diffrent machines for video calling.
- run commands := ```python Video_dual_server_communication.py``` & ```python Video_dual_client_communication.py```

Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.


## Approach

![Approach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/whisper/main/approach.png)

A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets.


## Setup

We used Python 3.9.9 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.10 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) for their fast tokenizer implementation and [ffmpeg-python](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python) for reading audio files. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command:

    pip install -U openai-whisper

Alternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies:

    pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git 

To update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run:

    pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git

It also requires the command-line tool [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers:

```bash
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```

You may need [`rust`](http://rust-lang.org) installed as well, in case [tokenizers](https://pypi.org/project/tokenizers/) does not provide a pre-built wheel for your platform. If you see installation errors during the `pip install` command above, please follow the [Getting started page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust development environment. Additionally, you may need to configure the `PATH` environment variable, e.g. `export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"`. If the installation fails with `No module named 'setuptools_rust'`, you need to install `setuptools_rust`, e.g. by running:

```bash
pip install setuptools-rust
```


## Available models and languages

There are five model sizes, four with English-only versions, offering speed and accuracy tradeoffs. Below are the names of the available models and their approximate memory requirements and relative speed. 


|  Size  | Parameters | English-only model | Multilingual model | Required VRAM | Relative speed |
|:------:|:----------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|  tiny  |    39 M    |     `tiny.en`      |       `tiny`       |     ~1 GB     |      ~32x      |
|  base  |    74 M    |     `base.en`      |       `base`       |     ~1 GB     |      ~16x      |
| small  |   244 M    |     `small.en`     |      `small`       |     ~2 GB     |      ~6x       |
| medium |   769 M    |    `medium.en`     |      `medium`      |     ~5 GB     |      ~2x       |
| large  |   1550 M   |        N/A         |      `large`       |    ~10 GB     |       1x       |

The `.en` models for English-only applications tend to perform better, especially for the `tiny.en` and `base.en` models. We observed that the difference becomes less significant for the `small.en` and `medium.en` models.

Whisper's performance varies widely depending on the language. The figure below shows a WER (Word Error Rate) breakdown by languages of the Fleurs dataset using the `large-v2` model. More WER and BLEU scores corresponding to the other models and datasets can be found in Appendix D in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356). The smaller, the better.
